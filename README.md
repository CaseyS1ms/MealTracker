# Meal Tracker 

## Overview 

A full stack web application that suggests meals based on what's available, while tracking batch-cooked portions. As someone living with ADHD, the mental load of deciding what to cook — and the perceived effort that comes with it — is a daily challenge. I built this app to help remedy that. Built with Spring Boot and React.js
